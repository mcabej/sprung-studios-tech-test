# Sprung Studios Tech Test

To start the project follow these steps: 
1. Run <code>npm install</code>
2. Run <code>npm start</code>

You should be good to go!


## Brief

Using the assets provided, your task is to create a prototype for PC/ Mac which replicates the following functionality:
- Populating the inventory
- Dragging/ Dropping with item stacking

The goal is to implement a responsive inventory system you might traditionally see in a game.

- The inventory system will start by randomly populating the grid with a range of items. 
- A user must be able to drag and drop items between any of the slots to rearrange them as they please. 
- If a slot is currently occupied, the two items occupying each slot will simply switch places. 
- Some items will be stackable â€“ allowing a user to combine the stack of two
items of the same type.

Please follow the rules below when creating the prototype:
- Please only use the assets provided
- Please use your own original code
- Make the code modular, appropriately creating classes where required
- Avoid downloading off-the-shelf assets. e.g. From the Unity Asset Store
- Feel free to experiment with your own animations
